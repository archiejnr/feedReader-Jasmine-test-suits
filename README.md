The project is about writing up tests for a web based RSS feeder that ensure that our application components are working properly.

# Getting started

To install the jasmine test suit. You must install it globally on your pc by running the command:
```
npm insatll -g jasmine

```
in the command prompt
To initialize the suite in your project make sure you navigate to your project using the command prompt and then enter the command:
```
jasmine init

```
If you open your file explorer you would realize that two new folders have been added to your project.
Your test are written in a .js file which should be located in the spec folder.
You must make sure you don't forget to include your jasmine file references in the html file so that the jasmine libraries can be loaded When you open your application.

#Seperation Of Code

It is highly recommended that all the testing code be in the .js file from the spec folder. This is done to ensure that the
testing and production code do not mix up which might cause unnecessary inconveniences in the future.
